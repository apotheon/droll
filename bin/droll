SYNTAX

    Die codes are constructed from up to five parts:

    1. Die Number (Optional; Default: 1)

        An optional number that determines how many of a die should be
        rolled.  For instance, if you wish to get the results of rolling
        two six-sided dice, the number would be 2.

    2. Roll Type (Mandatory; No Default)

        A single-letter code used to specify how rolls should be treated.

            d   Roll normally.

            x   On a result equal to or higher than a threshold value, roll
                another die of that type and add it to the total.

            e   On a result where all dice yield values equal to or higher
                than a threshold value, roll another die of that type and
                add it to the total.

            k   Only use the highest die values, up to a number of dice
                equal to a threshold value.  When the threshold is not
                specified, the default is 1.  When the "k" is capitalized "K",
                use the lowest die values instead.

            n   Count the number of dice that yield values equal to or
                higher than a threshhold value.  When the "n" is capitalized
                "N", count values equal to or lower than the threshhold
                instead.

    3. Die Value (Mandatory; No Default)

        Indicates the set of values the die can produce.  Two types of die
        value are supported: a normal positive integer value (a whole
        number higher than zero), and such a value preceded by a zero.  If
        preceded by a zero, it is treated as a die marked with a range of
        numbers from zero to the value following the zero.  Otherwise, it
        is treated as being marked with a range of numbers from one to the
        indicated value.

    4. Threshold (Optional; Default: Maximum Value)

        A threshold may be specified for exploding roll types by attaching
        a number, separated from the die value by a period.  Any die result
        equal to or greater than the threshold value causes another die to
        be rolled and added to the total.  The threshold is counted for
        every die when using the x Roll Type, or for the sum of all dice
        when using the e Roll Type.  It is ignored when using the d Roll
        Type, and a warning is issued.

    5. Modifier (Optional; No Default)

        A plus or minus sign can be used to indicate that a value should be
        added to, or subtracted from, the die roll total.  Following the
        plus or minus sign, a numerical value is specified to indicate what
        should be added or subtracted.  The modifier is applied to the roll
        total, and not to each individual die roll.

EXAMPLES

    d10     Roll a single ten-sided die for values between 1 and 10.

    2d3     Roll two three-sided dice for values between 1 and 3.  Add the
            results together, for a total between 2 and 6.

    3x02    Roll three three-sided dice for values between 0 and 2.  For
            each 2 result, roll another die of the same type.  Repeat as
            necessary, and add all values together.

    3x02.1  Same as 3x02, but explodes on 1 or higher instead of only on 2.

    3x02+3  Same as 3x02, but add 3 to the total.

    3e02    Roll three three-sided dice for values between 0 and 2 as
            though rolling 3d02.  If all three dice yield 2 results -- and
            only if all three dice yield 2 results, providing a 6 total --
            roll another three- sided die for values between 0 and 2.
            Threat this die as 1x02, and add the exploding total to the
            original 6 result.

    3e02.4  Same as 3e02, but roll an additional 1x02 if the total of the
            original 3d02 roll is equal to 4 or greater.

    3k02    Roll three three-sided dice for values between 0 and 2 as
            though rolling 3d02, but only keep the highest die.

    3k02.2  Same as 3k02, but keep the highest two dice.

    3K02.2  Same as 3k02.2, but keep the lowest two dice.

    3n10    Roll three ten-sided dice for values between 1 and 10, and
            count only the number of dice whose values are 10.

    3n10.6  Same as 3n10, but count the number of dice whose values are 6
            or higher.

    3N10    Roll three ten-sided dice for values between 1 and 10, and count
            only the number of dice whose values are 1.

    3N10.5  Same as 3N10, but count the number of dice whose values are 5 or
            lower.
